## Context

![illustration](illustration_sql_murder_mystery.png)

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a **murder** that occured **sometimes on Jan.15,2018** and that it took place in **SQL City**. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database.

All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use SQL to navigate through the vast network of information. The first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the cooresponding crime scene report from the police department's database.
